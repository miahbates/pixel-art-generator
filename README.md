# Generative art (in progress...) ğŸŸªğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ§
Experimenting with generative pixel art

## Set-up ğŸŒ„
```
// The code we write inside the setup function will run once, create canvas is measured in pixels.
// The code we write inside the draw function will run repeatedly, in an infinite loop, after that.

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

// OR you can have entire width and height of the window

function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
}
```
